Explanation:


HTML Structure:
1.The HTML consists of a div with the class full-screen-box which will take up the full screen.
2.Inside this div, there is another div with the class centered-text that contains the text "Zepto Apps".


CSS Styling:
.container: Reset the margin and padding to 0 to ensure the box takes up the full screen without any default margins or padding. 
  Setting height and width to 100% ensures that these elements take up the full viewport.
.full-screen-box: Use Flexbox to center the content both vertically and horizontally.
    height: 100vh and width: 100vw ensure that the div takes up the full viewport height and width.  
    The background color is set for visual distinction.
    The black border with 3px width also added.
.centered-text: Styles for the text to make it larger and bold, enhancing visibility.

This code creates a full-screen box with the text "Zepto Apps" perfectly centered both vertically and horizontally.
